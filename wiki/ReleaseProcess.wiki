#summary Release Process


Sxip packages and distributes the OpenID4Java library at http://code.sxip.com/openid4java/ .

The packaging is done with Ant, which is also the officially supported method for building the library from source. Maven2 is also provided as an alternate building and installation method.

The release process is documented below in order to provide for a consistent package.
