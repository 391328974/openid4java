#summary Release Process


Sxip packages and distributes the OpenID4Java library at http://code.sxip.com/openid4java/ .

The packaging is done with Ant, which is also the officially supported method for building the library from source. Maven2 is also provided as an alternate building and installation method.

The release process is documented below in order to provide for a consistent package.


= Ant =

 * project.properties:
		update the component.ver property to the desired new version number

 * ant dist


= Maven2 =

 * ...
 * submit bundle(s) to maven repo


Issue: the version number appears a number of POM files. If possible, it should be taken from project.properties or the VERSION file.


= SVN =

 * tag release revision
