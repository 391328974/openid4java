== Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy == 

Download and install (under JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security) the JCE
unlimited strength policy files, usually distributed along with JVMs
(but not included in standard packages). SUN's Java JCE policy files
can be found as separate downloads at the following URLs:

      http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp
      http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html

== Third party libraries ==

Third party libraries that provide unlimited strength JCE
implementations can also be used. One such library is provided by
Bouncy Castle:
